<!--
    This is a demonstration of how to run test methods in parallel.  In the suite tag add the "parallel" parameter
    and set its value to "method" this will parallelize the test methods.  One must also add the "thread-count"
    parameter and set its value to the number of methods.  If there are four test methods and the "thread-count" is
    4 then all four methods will run in parallel.  If the "thread-count" is only 3 then three methods will run in
    parallel and then the final method will be run serially after the first of the three methods finish running.
